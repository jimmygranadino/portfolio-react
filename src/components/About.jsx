                <p className="content-text">I'm an enthusiastic solutions-driven developer with an eye towards implementations that optimize business functions. As an analyst by experience & a creative at heart pushing me forward, I deconstruct challenges to their base components to find efficient outcomes while utilizing my soft skills to bring teams together.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p className="content-text">On a personal note - I grew up in Los Angeles, attended university in scenic Santa Cruz, poured it on at a startup in San Francisco, and took a globe-trekking gap year while living in Sydney. My life revolves around sports, music, photography and exploring the world one roadtrip/flight at a time.</p>
